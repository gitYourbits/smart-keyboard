       " ' Miss Bingley offered her the carriage,       and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane       testified such concern in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was       obliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to       remain at Netherfield for the present',\n",

       " '        Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she       could regard with any complacency',\n",

       " '”        “Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,” said Bingley; “but this       was all lost upon me',\n",

       " '        To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it       their hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at       the expense of their dear friend’s vulgar relations',\n",
       " '        With a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room       on leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to       coffee',\n",
       " ' She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit       her at all, till late in the evening, when she had the comfort of       seeing her asleep, and when it appeared to her rather right than       pleasant that she should go downstairs herself',\n",
       " ' On entering the       drawing-room she found the whole party at loo, and was       immediately invited to join them; but suspecting them to be       playing high she declined it, and making her sister the excuse,       said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay       below, with a book',\n",
       " ' Hurst looked at her with astonishment',\n",

       " ' She is a       great reader, and has no pleasure in anything else',\n",
       " '”        “I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,” cried       Elizabeth; “I am _not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in       many things',\n",
       " '”        “In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,” said       Bingley; “and I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her       quite well',\n",
       " '”        Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a       table where a few books were lying',\n",

       " ' Darcy!”        “It ought to be good,” he replied, “it has been the work of many       generations',\n",

       " '”        “All this she must possess,” added Darcy, “and to all this she       must yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of       her mind by extensive reading',\n",

       " ' The first       half-hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she should suffer       from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to the       other side of the fireplace, that she might be further from the       door',\n",
       " ' He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone       else',\n",

       " ' At length, quite       exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book, which       she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his, she       gave a great yawn and said, “How pleasant it is to spend an       evening in this way! I declare after all there is no enjoyment       like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a       book! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I       have not an excellent library',\n",
       " '”        No one made any reply',\n",
       " ' She then yawned again, threw aside her       book, and cast her eyes round the room in quest for some       amusement; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss       Bennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said:        “By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a       dance at Netherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on       it, to consult the wishes of the present party; I am much       mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be       rather a punishment than a pleasure',\n",
       " '”        “If you mean Darcy,” cried her brother, “he may go to bed, if he       chooses, before it begins—but as for the ball, it is quite a       settled thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup       enough, I shall send round my cards',\n",
       " '”        “I should like balls infinitely better,” she replied, “if they       were carried on in a different manner; but there is something       insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting',\n",
       " ' It       would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of       dancing were made the order of the day',\n",
       " '”        “Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would       not be near so much like a ball',\n",
       " '”        Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up and       walked about the room',\n",
       " ' Her figure was elegant, and she walked       well; but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly       studious',\n",
       " ' In the desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one       effort more, and, turning to Elizabeth, said:        “Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and       take a turn about the room',\n",
       " ' I assure you it is very refreshing       after sitting so long in one attitude',\n",
       " '”        Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately',\n",
       " ' Miss       Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr',\n",
       " '       Darcy looked up',\n",
       " ' He was as much awake to the novelty of attention       in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously       closed his book',\n",
       " ' He was directly invited to join their party, but       he declined it, observing that he could imagine but two motives       for their choosing to walk up and down the room together, with       either of which motives his joining them would interfere',\n",
       " ' “What       could he mean? She was dying to know what could be his       meaning?”—and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand       him?        “Not at all,” was her answer; “but depend upon it, he means to be       severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to       ask nothing about it',\n",
       " '”        Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr',\n",
       " ' Darcy       in anything, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation       of his two motives',\n",
       " '        “I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,” said he,       as soon as she allowed him to speak',\n",
       " ' “You either choose this       method of passing the evening because you are in each other’s       confidence, and have secret affairs to discuss, or because you       are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage       in walking; if the first, I would be completely in your way, and       if the second, I can admire you much better as I sit by the       fire',\n",
       " '”        “Oh! shocking!” cried Miss Bingley',\n",
       " ' “I never heard anything so       abominable',\n",
       " ' How shall we punish him for such a speech?”        “Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,” said       Elizabeth',\n",

       " ' Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, _do_       divert me, I own, and I laugh at them whenever I can',\n",
